Day Trails
--------

Day trails allow you to track all the places you visit in a day on a day by day map view. This feature is disabled by default but can be enabled from Settings/Personalize.

Health Events
----------
Dyrii allows you to tag health events in your journal which then gets displayed in the Health section where it can be printed into a report. 

To add health event, navigate to the Editor and click on the "Add Symptoms" link on the toolbar.


Place Checkins
-------

Place checkin is a feature that allows you to bookmark a specific location in an entry. It works very similar to how Facebook Check in works. To access this feature, select the "Checkin" option from the new post screen.



The Checkin page will automatically show you the list of places that are near your current location. If the list of places does not load automatically, then click on the location triangle button on the top to reload the list. 

You can also search for a specific location using the search bar on the top.



Checkin information is stored against the post entry. We store the following information for checkins.

Name of the Place
Place Category (for example, restaurant, coffee shop, etc.) 
Address of the Place
Coordinates of the Place
Google Places URL of the Place
The above information is also indexed and shown on the Perspective section. Right now the perspective section shows very limited information about these checkins but we plan to expand this in the future to also display checkin statistics.
