You can represent code blocks fairly easily::

   import numpy as np
   x = np.random.rand(12)

Or literally include code:

Making links
============

It is easy to make a link to `yahoo <http://yahoo.com>`_ or to some
section inside this document (see :ref:`making-a-table`) or another
document.

You can also reference classes, modules, functions, etc that are
documented using the sphinx `autodoc
<http://sphinx.pocoo.org/ext/autodoc.html>`_ facilites.  For example,
see the module :mod:`matplotlib.backend_bases` documentation, or the
class :class:`~matplotlib.backend_bases.LocationEvent`, or the method
:meth:`~matplotlib.backend_bases.FigureCanvasBase.mpl_connect`.
