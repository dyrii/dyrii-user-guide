Welcome to Dyrii User Manual!
==================================================

We created this guide to help users of our app learn more about the app. This guide is organized into multiple chapters as indicated in the Table of Contents below. To help you easily navigate, we have also indexed the chapters on the left sidebar. The guide is also downloadable as a PDF or EPUB file so that you can read it offline at your own pace. Downloads option is located on the bottom section of the left sidebar under "v: latest" link. Each chapter will provide notes and instructions on how to use the app on iOS and Mac along with detailed screenshots. If you see anything missing or if you have questions, please email us at support@dyrii.com or leave a comment on this post.
