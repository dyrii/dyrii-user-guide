.. index:: Timeline
Timeline
--------
This view provides a rolling timeline of all your entries in the journal. If you have enabled iCloud, this view in iOS will fetch your posts from iCloud in a batches for 100 and consecutive batches will be downloaded as you scroll down to the bottom of this view. On macOS, this behavior is slighly different where we download all the entries on the device instead of batching it like we do on iOS.

In this view, all your journal entries are loaded here grouped and sorted by creation date. We will tell you more in Chapter 6 Personalize on how to change this default view from Settings.

.. index:: Day View
Day View
------------
While some users may like a rolling timeline view, some may prefer a more traditional day by day view format. The Day view addresses this need. The users are also allowed to set this view as their default view from under Menu.

iOS: While the default view is loaded for the current week, users can swipe left or right to scroll through their weeks. The view on the top has a top-down swipe gesture to expand the number of visible days to display a full month.

The today view also displays all the places you have visited during the given day. Feature is turned off by default due to privacy reasons but can be turned on from Settings/Personalize/Track Place Visited.

Mac: On Mac, the today view is integrated with the Calander view located at the bottom of the Sidebar. Clicking any one of the date cells will change the timeline view to display posts from the selected day. The selected day is highlighted in the calendar view with a round circular shade as well as displayed on the timeline view header. To deselect the day view, simply click on the X button on the top of the view.

The Health perspective provides a view into your health and mood entries group by month and year. There an option to even print this as a PDF report so that you can takeit with you to the doctor.

Atlas

Sometimes displaying entries in a list format is not enough, specically when you want to browse through your entires based on places you have visited across the globe. We have added Atlas view for that reason. You can get to this view from the Main Menu.
