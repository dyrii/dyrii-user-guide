Why Dyrii?
___________
Dyrii was born out of the struggle between two contrasting ideas: a) allowing users to bring their own storage vs b) taking over the ownership of providing and managing the storage for the user.

Being an avid journal user ourselves, we needed the assurance that we own and control our journals and not anybody else. So, option b wasn't really an option. And that's how Dyrii was born!

Our goal with Dyrii is to provide users a powerful, let simple journaling tool that can last a lifetime.
