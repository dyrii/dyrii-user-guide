Day View
------------
While some users may like a rolling timeline view, some may prefer a more traditional day by day view format. The Today view addresses this need. The users are also allowed to set this view as their default view from under Menu.

iOS
While the default view is loaded for the current week, users can swipe left or right to scroll through their weeks. The view on the top has a top-down swipe gesture to expand the number of visible days to display a full month.

The today view also displays all the places you have visited during the given day. Feature is turned off by default due to privacy reasons but can be turned on from Settings/Personalize/Track Place Visited.

Mac
On Mac, the today view is integrated with the Calander view located at the bottom of the Sidebar. Clicking any one of the date cells will change the timeline view to display posts from the selected day. The selected day is highlighted in the calendar view with a round circular shade as well as displayed on the timeline view header.

Place Checkins

Place checkin is a feature that allows you to bookmark a specific location in an entry. It works very similar to how Facebook Check in works. To access this feature, select the "Checkin" option from the new post screen.



The Checkin page will automatically show you the list of places that are near your current location. If the list of places does not load automatically, then click on the location triangle button on the top to reload the list. 

You can also search for a specific location using the search bar on the top.



Checkin information is stored against the post entry. We store the following information for checkins.

Name of the Place
Place Category (for example, restaurant, coffee shop, etc.) 
Address of the Place
Coordinates of the Place
Google Places URL of the Place
The above information is also indexed and shown on the Perspective section. Right now the perspective section shows very limited information about these checkins but we plan to expand this in the future to also display checkin statistics.
