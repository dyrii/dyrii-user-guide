Dyrii URL Scheme
--------
The URL scheme lets pro users and developers of other apps send commands and special instructions to Dyrii. In this section we will explain how URL schemes work.

Currently Dyrii supports only following two commands:
1) dyrIi://pos: This command is used to open Dyrii with New Post Screen
2) dyrIi://pin: This command is used to directly post an entry of type location pin containing current device geolocation.


Dyrii Backup File Format
--------
Dyrii uses a custom JSON file format for creating it's backup file. In this section, we will provide the techncial detials of this JSON file so that developers of other app can write data import programs in their apps to consume your data.
